# Plant Life Monitoring System

<b>Summary</b>: Plant Life Monitoring System is a final project completed for my Microcomputers II class at Kettering University. It is a WiFi-enabled sensor package for monitoring metrics of indoor plants utilizing an Espressif ESP8266 MCU. These metrics are communicated to an email account of the user via SMTP. (in this case using Google's Gmail servers) The device is able measure light (lux) levels, soil resistivity (approximating percentage moisture content of soil), and ambient temperature (degrees fahrenheit). Additionally, it provides the user with information regarding the specific device's battery voltage, update interval, etc.
